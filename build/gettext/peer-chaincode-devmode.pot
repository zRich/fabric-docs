msgid "Using dev mode"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/peer-chaincode-devmode.rst:4
msgid "Normally chaincodes are started and maintained by peer. However in “dev” mode, chaincode is built and started by the user. This mode is useful during chaincode development phase for rapid code/build/run/debug cycle turnaround."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/peer-chaincode-devmode.rst:9
msgid "To keep this a realistic “dev” environment, we are going to keep it “out of the box” - with one exception: we create two channels to show how the single running instance can be accessed from multiple channels."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/peer-chaincode-devmode.rst:13
msgid "Note: Make sure peer is not using TLS when running in dev mode."

msgid "Start the peer in dev mode"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/peer-chaincode-devmode.rst:33
msgid "The above command starts the peer using the default MSP. The ``--peer-chaincodedev=true`` puts it in “dev” mode."

msgid "Create channels ch1 and ch2"

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/peer-chaincode-devmode.rst:52
msgid "Above assumes orderer is reachable on ``127.0.0.1:7050``. The orderer now is tracking channels ch1 and ch2 for the default configuration."

msgid "Start the chaincode"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/peer-chaincode-devmode.rst:71
msgid "The chaincode is started with peer and chaincode logs indicating successful registration with the peer. Note that at this stage the chaincode is not associated with any channel. This is done in subsequent steps using the ``instantiate`` command."

msgid "Use the chaincode"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/peer-chaincode-devmode.rst:78
msgid "Even though you are in ``--peer-chaincodedev`` mode, you still have to install the chaincode so the life-cycle system chaincode can go through its checks normally. This requirement may be removed in future when in ``--peer-chaincodedev`` mode."

#: ../../source/peer-chaincode-devmode.rst:105
