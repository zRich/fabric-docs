msgid "At the heart of a blockchain network is a smart contract. In PaperNet, the code in the commercial paper smart contract defines the valid states for commercial paper, and the transaction logic that transition a paper from one state to another. In this topic, we're going to show you how to implement a real world smart contract that governs the process of issuing, buying and redeeming commercial paper."

msgid "A smart contract defines the different states of a business object and governs the processes that move the object between these different states. Smart contracts are important because they allow architects and smart contract developers to define the key business processes and data that are shared across the different organizations collaborating in a blockchain network."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:34
msgid "In the PaperNet network, the smart contract is shared by the different network participants, such as MagnetoCorp and DigiBank.  The same version of the smart contract must be used by all applications connected to the network so that they jointly implement the same shared business processes and data."

msgid "The CommercialPaperContract class contains the transaction definitions for commercial paper -- issue, buy and redeem. It's these transactions that bring commercial papers into existence and move them through their lifecycle. We'll examine these transactions soon, but for now notice how CommercialPaperContract extends the Hyperledger Fabric Contract class. This built-in class, and the Context class, were brought into scope earlier:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Most importantly, org.papernet.commercialpaper is very descriptive -- this smart contract is the agreed definition of commercial paper for all PaperNet organizations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:92
msgid "Usually there will only be one smart contract per file -- contracts tend to have different lifecycles, which makes it sensible to separate them. However, in some cases, multiple smart contracts might provide syntactic help for applications, e.g. EuroBond, DollarBond, YenBond, but essentially provide the same function. In such cases, smart contracts and transactions can be disambiguated."

msgid "The issue method is automatically given control by the contract whenever an application makes a request to issue a commercial paper. The transaction property values are made available to the method via the corresponding variables. See how an application submits a transaction using the Hyperledger Fabric SDK in the application topic, using a sample application program."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:129
msgid "You might have noticed an extra variable in the issue definition -- ctx. It's called the transaction context, and it's always first. By default, it maintains both per-contract and per-transaction information relevant to transaction logic. For example, it would contain MagnetoCorp's specified transaction identifier, a MagnetoCorp issuing user's digital certificate, as well as access to the ledger API."

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:219
msgid "It results in the issue method being passed control:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:241
msgid "The logic is simple: take the transaction input variables, create a new commercial paper paper, add it to the list of all commercial papers using paperList, and return the new commercial paper (serialized as a buffer) as the transaction response."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:246
msgid "See how paperList is retrieved from the transaction context to provide access to the list of commercial papers. issue(), buy() and redeem() continually re-access ctx.paperList to keep the list of commercial papers up-to-date."

msgid "The logic for the buy transaction is a little more elaborate:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:282
msgid "See how the transaction checks currentOwner and that paper is TRADING before changing the owner with paper.setOwner(newOwner). The basic flow is simple though -- check some pre-conditions, set the new owner, update the commercial paper on the ledger, and return the updated commercial paper (serialized as a buffer) as the transaction response."

msgid "A few important points to note:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:325
msgid "This is an in-memory representation; we'll see later how it appears on the ledger."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:329
msgid "The CommercialPaper class extends the State class. State is an application-defined class which creates a common abstraction for a state. All states have a business object class which they represent, a composite key, can be serialized and de-serialized, and so on.  State helps our code be more legible when we are storing more than one business object type on the ledger. Examine the State class in the state.js file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:338
msgid "A paper computes its own key when it is created -- this key will be used when the ledger is accessed. The key is formed from a combination of issuer and paperNumber."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:350
msgid "A paper is moved to the ISSUED state by the transaction, not by the paper class. That's because it's the smart contract that governs the lifecycle state of the paper. For example, an import transaction might create a new set of papers immediately in the TRADING state."

msgid "The rest of the CommercialPaper class contains simple helper methods:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:363

msgid "Access the ledger"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:376
msgid "Now locate the PaperList class in the paperlist.js file:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:383
msgid "This utility class is used to manage all PaperNet commercial papers in Hyperledger Fabric state database. The PaperList data structures are described in more detail in the architecture topic."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:387
msgid "Like the CommercialPaper class, this class extends an application-defined StateList class which creates a common abstraction for a list of states -- in this case, all the commercial papers in PaperNet."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:391
msgid "The addPaper() method is a simple veneer over the StateList.addState() method:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:400
msgid "You can see in the StateList.js file how the StateList class uses the Fabric API putState() to write the commercial paper as state data in the ledger:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:413
msgid "Every piece of state data in a ledger requires these two fundamental elements:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:415
msgid "Key: key is formed with createCompositeKey() using a fixed name and the key of state. The name was assigned when the PaperList object was constructed, and state.getSplitKey() determines each state's unique key."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:420
msgid "Data: data is simply the serialized form of the commercial paper state, created using the State.serialize() utility method. The State class serializes and deserializes data using JSON, and the State's business object class as required, in our case CommercialPaper, again set when the PaperList object was constructed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:427
msgid "Notice how a StateList doesn't store anything about an individual state or the total list of states -- it delegates all of that to the Fabric state database. This is an important design pattern -- it reduces the opportunity for ledger MVCC collisions in Hyperledger Fabric."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:432
msgid "The StateList getState() and updateState() methods work in similar ways:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:451
msgid "See how they use the Fabric APIs putState(), getState() and createCompositeKey() to access the ledger. We'll expand this smart contract later to list all commercial papers in paperNet -- what might the method look like to implement this ledger retrieval?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:456
msgid "That's it! In this topic you've understood how to implement the smart contract for PaperNet.  You can move to the next sub topic to see how an application calls the smart contract using the Fabric SDK."
