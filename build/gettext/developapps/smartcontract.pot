msgid "At the heart of a blockchain network is a smart contract. In PaperNet, the code in the commercial paper smart contract defines the valid states for commercial paper, and the transaction logic that transition a paper from one state to another. In this topic, we're going to show you how to implement a real world smart contract that governs the process of issuing, buying and redeeming commercial paper."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:12
msgid "We're going to cover:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:21
msgid "If you'd like, you can download the sample and even run it locally. It is written in JavaScript, but the logic is quite language independent, so you'll be easily able to see what's going on! (The sample will become available for Java and GOLANG as well.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:28
msgid "A smart contract defines the different states of a business object and governs the processes that move the object between these different states. Smart contracts are important because they allow architects and smart contract developers to define the key business processes and data that are shared across the different organizations collaborating in a blockchain network."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:34
msgid "In the PaperNet network, the smart contract is shared by the different network participants, such as MagnetoCorp and DigiBank.  The same version of the smart contract must be used by all applications connected to the network so that they jointly implement the same shared business processes and data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:41
msgid "A copy of the PaperNet commercial paper smart contract is contained in papercontract.js. View it with your browser, or open it in your favourite editor if you've downloaded it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:46
msgid "You may notice from the file path that this is MagnetoCorp's copy of the smart contract.  MagnetoCorp and DigiBank must agree the version of the smart contract that they are going to use. For now, it doesn't matter which organization's copy you look at, they are all the same."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:51
msgid "Spend a few moments looking at the overall structure of the smart contract; notice that it's quite short! Towards the top of papercontract.js, you'll see that there's a definition for the commercial paper smart contract:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:59
msgid "The CommercialPaperContract class contains the transaction definitions for commercial paper -- issue, buy and redeem. It's these transactions that bring commercial papers into existence and move them through their lifecycle. We'll examine these transactions soon, but for now notice how CommercialPaperContract extends the Hyperledger Fabric Contract class. This built-in class, and the Context class, were brought into scope earlier:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:73
msgid "Our commercial paper contract will use built-in features of these classes, such as automatic method invocation, a per-transaction context, transaction handlers, and class-shared state."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:78
msgid "Notice also how the class constructor uses its superclass to initialize itself with an explicit contract name:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:88
msgid "Most importantly, org.papernet.commercialpaper is very descriptive -- this smart contract is the agreed definition of commercial paper for all PaperNet organizations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:92
msgid "Usually there will only be one smart contract per file -- contracts tend to have different lifecycles, which makes it sensible to separate them. However, in some cases, multiple smart contracts might provide syntactic help for applications, e.g. EuroBond, DollarBond, YenBond, but essentially provide the same function. In such cases, smart contracts and transactions can be disambiguated."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:100
msgid "Within the class, locate the issue method."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:106
msgid "This function is given control whenever this contract is called to issue a commercial paper. Recall how commercial paper 00001 was created with the following transaction:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:119
msgid "We've changed the variable names for programming style, but see how these properties map almost directly to the issue method variables."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:122
msgid "The issue method is automatically given control by the contract whenever an application makes a request to issue a commercial paper. The transaction property values are made available to the method via the corresponding variables. See how an application submits a transaction using the Hyperledger Fabric SDK in the application topic, using a sample application program."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:129
msgid "You might have noticed an extra variable in the issue definition -- ctx. It's called the transaction context, and it's always first. By default, it maintains both per-contract and per-transaction information relevant to transaction logic. For example, it would contain MagnetoCorp's specified transaction identifier, a MagnetoCorp issuing user's digital certificate, as well as access to the ledger API."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:136
msgid "See how the smart contract extends the default transaction context by implementing its own createContext() method rather than accepting the default implementation:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:146
msgid "This extended context adds a custom property paperList to the defaults:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:158
msgid "We'll soon see how ctx.paperList can be subsequently used to help store and retrieve all PaperNet commercial papers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:161
msgid "To solidify your understanding of the structure of a smart contract transaction, locate the buy and redeem transaction definitions, and see if you can see how they map to their corresponding commercial paper transactions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:165
msgid "The buy transaction:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:181
msgid "The redeem transaction:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:195
msgid "In both cases, observe the 1:1 correspondence between the commercial paper transaction and the smart contract method definition.  And don't worry about the async and await keywords -- they allow asynchronous JavaScript functions to be treated like their synchronous cousins in other programming languages."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:205
msgid "Now that you've seen how contracts are structured and transactions are defined, let's focus on the logic within the smart contract."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:208
msgid "Recall the first issue transaction:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:219
msgid "It results in the issue method being passed control:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:241
msgid "The logic is simple: take the transaction input variables, create a new commercial paper paper, add it to the list of all commercial papers using paperList, and return the new commercial paper (serialized as a buffer) as the transaction response."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:246
msgid "See how paperList is retrieved from the transaction context to provide access to the list of commercial papers. issue(), buy() and redeem() continually re-access ctx.paperList to keep the list of commercial papers up-to-date."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:250
msgid "The logic for the buy transaction is a little more elaborate:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:282
msgid "See how the transaction checks currentOwner and that paper is TRADING before changing the owner with paper.setOwner(newOwner). The basic flow is simple though -- check some pre-conditions, set the new owner, update the commercial paper on the ledger, and return the updated commercial paper (serialized as a buffer) as the transaction response."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:288
msgid "Why don't you see if you can understand the logic for the redeem transaction?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:293
msgid "We've seen how to define and implement the issue, buy and redeem transactions using the CommercialPaper and PaperList classes. Let's end this topic by seeing how these classes work."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:297
msgid "Locate the CommercialPaper class in the paper.js file:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:304
msgid "This class contains the in-memory representation of a commercial paper state. See how the createInstance method initializes a new commercial paper with the provided parameters:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:314
msgid "Recall how this class was used by the issue transaction:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:320
msgid "See how every time the issue transaction is called, a new in-memory instance of a commercial paper is created containing the transaction data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:323
msgid "A few important points to note:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:355
msgid "The rest of the CommercialPaper class contains simple helper methods:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:363
msgid "Recall how methods like this were used by the smart contract to move the commercial paper through its lifecycle. For example, in the redeem transaction we saw:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:376
msgid "Now locate the PaperList class in the paperlist.js file:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:383
msgid "This utility class is used to manage all PaperNet commercial papers in Hyperledger Fabric state database. The PaperList data structures are described in more detail in the architecture topic."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:387
msgid "Like the CommercialPaper class, this class extends an application-defined StateList class which creates a common abstraction for a list of states -- in this case, all the commercial papers in PaperNet."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:391
msgid "The addPaper() method is a simple veneer over the StateList.addState() method:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:400
msgid "You can see in the StateList.js file how the StateList class uses the Fabric API putState() to write the commercial paper as state data in the ledger:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:413
msgid "Every piece of state data in a ledger requires these two fundamental elements:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:427
msgid "Notice how a StateList doesn't store anything about an individual state or the total list of states -- it delegates all of that to the Fabric state database. This is an important design pattern -- it reduces the opportunity for ledger MVCC collisions in Hyperledger Fabric."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:432
msgid "The StateList getState() and updateState() methods work in similar ways:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:451
msgid "See how they use the Fabric APIs putState(), getState() and createCompositeKey() to access the ledger. We'll expand this smart contract later to list all commercial papers in paperNet -- what might the method look like to implement this ledger retrieval?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/smartcontract.md:456
msgid "That's it! In this topic you've understood how to implement the smart contract for PaperNet.  You can move to the next sub topic to see how an application calls the smart contract using the Fabric SDK."
