It is possible to generate multiple SSH keys and to name the resulting files differently. See the `ssh-keygen <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh-keygen>`__ documentation for details on how to do that. Once you have generated non-default keys, you need to configure SSH to use the correct key for Gerrit. In that case, you need to create a ``~/.ssh/config`` file modeled after the one below."
