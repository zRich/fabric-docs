msgid "You don't need to supply the Change-Id identifier for a new commit; this is added automatically by the ``commit-msg`` Git hook associated with the repository. If you subsequently amend your commit and resubmit it, using the same Change-Id value as the initial commit will guarantee that Gerrit will recognize that subsequent commit as an amended commit with respect to the earlier one."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Gerrit/changes.rst:44
msgid "Commits must :doc:`build cleanly <../dev-setup/build>` when applied on top of each other, thus avoiding breaking bisectability. Each commit should address a single identifiable JIRA issue and should be logically self-contained. For example, one commit might fix whitespace issues, another commit might rename a function, while a third commit could change some code's functionality."

#: ../../source/Gerrit/changes.rst:73
msgid "To ensure stability of the code and limit possible regressions, we use a Continuous Integration (CI) process based on Jenkins which triggers a build on several platforms and runs tests against every change request being submitted. It is your responsibility to check that your CR passes these tests. No CR will ever be merged if it fails the tests and you shouldn't expect anybody to pay attention to your CRs until they pass the CI tests."

#: ../../source/Gerrit/changes.rst:81
msgid "To check on the status of the CI process, simply look at your CR on Gerrit, following the URL that was given to you as the result of the push in the previous step. The History section at the bottom of the page will display a set of actions taken by \"Hyperledger Jobbuilder\" corresponding to the CI process being executed."

msgid "In case of failure, explore the logs linked from the CR History. If you spot a problem with your CR, amend your commit and push it to update it, which will automatically kick off the CI process again."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Gerrit/changes.rst:94
msgid "If you see nothing wrong with your CR, it might be that the CI process simply failed for some reason unrelated to your change. In that case you may want to restart the CI process by posting a reply to your CR with the simple content \"reverify\". Check the `CI management page <https://github.com/hyperledger/ci-management/blob/master/docs/source/fabric_ci_process.rst>`__ for additional information and options on this."
