msgid "Even though, in Linux, Go's ``GOPATH`` variable can be a colon-separated list of directories, and will use a default value of ``$HOME/go`` if it is unset, the current Fabric build framework still requires you to set and export that variable, and it must contain **only** the single directory name for your Go workspace. (This restriction might be removed in a future release.)"

#: ../../source/prereqs.rst:83
msgid "Second, you should (again, in the appropriate startup file) extend your command search path to include the Go ``bin`` directory, such as the following example for ``bash`` under Linux:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/prereqs.rst:91
msgid "While this directory may not exist in a new Go workspace installation, it is populated later by the Fabric build system with a small number of Go executables used by other parts of the build system. So even if you currently have no such directory yet, extend your shell search path as above."

msgid "However experience has shown this to be a poor development environment with limited functionality. It is suitable to run Docker based scenarios, such as :doc:`getting_started`, but you may have difficulties with operations involving the ``make`` and ``docker`` commands."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/prereqs.rst:150
msgid "On Windows 10 you should use the native Docker distribution and you may use the Windows PowerShell. However, for the ``binaries`` command to succeed you will still need to have the ``uname`` command available. You can get it as part of Git but beware that only the 64bit version is supported."
