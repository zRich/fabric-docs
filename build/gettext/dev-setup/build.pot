msgid "Before running the unit tests, a PKCS #11 cryptographic token implementation must be installed and configured. The PKCS #11 API is used by the bccsp component of Fabric to interact with devices, such as hardware security modules (HSMs), that store cryptographic information and perform cryptographic computations. For test environments, SoftHSM can be used to satisfy this requirement."

msgid "Configuration typically involves copying ``/etc/softhsm2.conf`` to ``$HOME/.config/softhsm2/softhsm2.conf`` and changing ``directories.tokendir`` to an appropriate location. Please see the man page for ``softhsm2.conf`` for details."
