msgid "Before running the unit tests, a PKCS #11 cryptographic token implementation must be installed and configured. The PKCS #11 API is used by the bccsp component of Fabric to interact with devices, such as hardware security modules (HSMs), that store cryptographic information and perform cryptographic computations. For test environments, SoftHSM can be used to satisfy this requirement."

#: ../../source/dev-setup/build.rst:32
msgid "Once SoftHSM is installed, additional configuration may be required. For example, the default configuration file stores token data in a system directory that unprivileged users are unable to write to."

#: ../../source/dev-setup/build.rst:36
msgid "Configuration typically involves copying ``/etc/softhsm2.conf`` to ``$HOME/.config/softhsm2/softhsm2.conf`` and changing ``directories.tokendir`` to an appropriate location. Please see the man page for ``softhsm2.conf`` for details."

For example, logging level manipulation through the environment is shown below:"
