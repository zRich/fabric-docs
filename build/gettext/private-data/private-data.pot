msgid "In cases where a group of organizations on a channel need to keep data private from other organizations on that channel, they have the option to create a new channel comprising just the organizations who need access to the data. However, creating separate channels in each of these cases creates additional administrative overhead (maintaining chaincode versions, policies, MSPs, etc), and doesn't allow for use cases in which you want all channel participants to see a transaction while keeping a portion of the data private."

msgid "That's why, starting in v1.2, Fabric offers the ability to create private data collections, which allow a defined subset of organizations on a channel the ability to endorse, commit, or query private data without having to create a separate channel."

msgid "Collection members may decide to share the private data with other parties if they get into a dispute or if they want to transfer the asset to a third party. The third party can then compute the hash of the private data and see if it matches the state on the channel ledger, proving that the state existed between the collection members at a certain point in time."

msgid "The Distributor might want to make private transactions with the Farmer and Shipper to keep the terms of the trades confidential from the Wholesaler and the Retailer (so as not to expose the markup they're charging)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/private-data/private-data.md:75
msgid "The Distributor may also want to have a separate private data relationship with the Wholesaler because it charges them a lower price than it does the Retailer."

msgid "Rather than defining many small channels for each of these relationships, multiple private data collections (PDC) can be defined to share private data between:"

#: ../../source/private-data/private-data.md:91
msgid "Using this example, peers owned by the Distributor will have multiple private databases inside their ledger which includes the private data from the Distributor, Farmer and Shipper relationship and the Distributor and Wholesaler relationship. Because these databases are kept separate from the database that holds the channel ledger, private data is sometimes referred to as \"SideDB\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/private-data/private-data.md:102
msgid "When private data collections are referenced in chaincode, the transaction flow is slightly different in order to protect the confidentiality of the private data as transactions are proposed, endorsed, and committed to the ledger."

msgid "For very sensitive data, even the parties sharing the private data might want --- or might be required by government regulations --- to periodically \"purge\" the data on their peers, leaving behind a hash of the data on the blockchain to serve as immutable evidence of the private data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/private-data/private-data.md:150
msgid "In some of these cases, the private data only needs to exist on the peer's private database until it can be replicated into a database external to the peer's blockchain. The data might also only need to exist on the peers until a chaincode business process is done with it (trade settled, contract fulfilled, etc)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/private-data/private-data.md:155
msgid "To support these use cases, private data can be purged if it has not been modified for a configurable number of blocks. Purged private data cannot be queried from chaincode, and is not available to other requesting peers."
