msgid "Self-executing logic that encodes the rules for specific types of network transactions. Chaincode (currently written in Go) is installed and instantiated onto a channel's peers by an appropriately authorized member. End users then invoke chaincode through a client-side application that interfaces with a network peer. Chaincode runs network transactions, which if validated, are appended to the shared ledger and modify world state."
