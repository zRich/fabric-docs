"In previous versions of Fabric, the peer event service was known as the "
"event hub. This service sent events any time a new block was added to the "
"peer's ledger, regardless of the channel to which that block pertained, and "
"it was only accessible to members of the organization running the eventing "
"peer (i.e., the one being connected to for events)."

#: ../../source/peer_event_services.rst:13
msgid ""
"Starting with v1.1, there are two new services which provide events. These "
"services use an entirely different design to provide events on a per-channel"
" basis. This means that registration for events occurs at the level of the "
"channel instead of the peer, allowing for fine-grained control over access "
"to the peer's data. Requests to receive events are accepted from identities "
"outside of the peer's organization (as defined by the channel "
"configuration). This also provides greater reliability and a way to receive "
"events that may have been missed (whether due to a connectivity issue or "
"because the peer is joining a network that has already been running)."

"This service sends \"filtered\" blocks, minimal sets of information about "
"blocks that have been committed to the ledger. It is intended to be used in "
"a network where owners of the peers wish for external clients to primarily "
"receive information about their transactions and the status of those "
"transactions. If any events were set by a chaincode, these can be found "
"within the ``FilteredChaincodeAction`` of the filtered block."

"Registration for events from either service is done by sending an envelope "
"containing a deliver seek info message to the peer that contains the desired"
" start and stop positions, the seek behavior (block until ready or fail if "
"not ready). There are helper variables ``SeekOldest`` and ``SeekNewest`` "
"that can be used to indicate the oldest (i.e. first) block or the newest "
"(i.e. last) block on the ledger. To have the services send events "
"indefinitely, the ``SeekInfo`` message should include a stop position of "
"``MAXINT64``."
