"Configuration for a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network is managed by "
"policies. These policies generally reside in the channel configuration. The "
"primary purpose of this document is to explain how policies are defined in "
"and interact with the channel configuration. However, policies may also be "
"specified in some other places, such as chaincodes, so this information may "
"be of interest outside the scope of channel configuration."

"区块链网络的配置是由策略管理的。这些策略通常属于通道配置。本文档的主要目的是解释策略在通道配置中是如何定义的，以及策略是如何与通道配置交互的。但是，策略也可以在其他一些地方指定，比如链码，因此本文档的这些信息可能超出了通道配置的范围。"

msgid ""
"At its most basic level, a policy is a function which accepts as input a set"
" of signed data and evaluates successfully, or returns an error because some"
" aspect of the signed data did not satisfy the policy."
msgstr "在最基本的层次上，策略是一个函数，它接受一组带签名的数据作为输入，然后运算成功，或者因为带签名数据的某些方面不满足策略而返回一个错误。"

#: ../../source/policies.rst:19
msgid ""
"More concretely, policies test whether the signer or signers of some data "
"meet some condition required for those signatures to be considered 'valid'. "
"This is useful for determining that the correct parties have agreed to a "
"transaction, or change."
msgstr ""
"更具体地说，策略为了判断某些数据的签名是否“有效”，而测试数据的签名者是否满足某些必要的条件。这用来判断正确的参与方是否同意进行交易或更改。"

"For example a policy may define any of the following: \\* Administrators "
"from 2 out 5 possible different organizations must sign. \\* Any member from"
" any organization must sign. \\* Two specific certificates must both sign."

"**SignaturePolicy**: This policy type is the most powerful, and specifies "
"the policy as a combination of evaluation rules for MSP Principals. It "

msgid ""
"**ImplicitMetaPolicy**: This policy type is less flexible than "
"SignaturePolicy, and is only valid in the context of configuration. It "

"good default rules like \"A majority of the organization admin policies\"."
msgstr ""
"**ImplicitMetaPolicy**：隐式的元策略，这种策略类型不如SignaturePolicy灵活，并且只在配置的上下文中有效。它在配置层次结构中更深入地聚合了评估策略的结果，这种聚合结果最终由SignaturePolicies定义。它支持良好的默认规则，比如“组织管理策略的大多数”。"
