msgid ""
"The configtxgen tool's output is largely controlled by the content of "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For many configtxgen operations, a profile name must be supplied.  Profiles "
"are a way to express multiple similar configurations in a single file.  For "
"instance, one profile might define a channel with 3 orgs, and another might "
"define one with 4 orgs.  To accomplish this without the length of the file "
"becoming burdensome, configtx.yaml depends on the standard YAML feature of "
"anchors and references.  Base parts of the configuration are tagged with an "
"anchor like &OrdererDefaults and then merged into a profile with a reference"
" like <<: *OrdererDefaults.  Note, when configtxgen is operating under a "
"profile, environment variable overrides do not need to include the profile "
"prefix and may be referenced relative to the root element of the profile.  "
"For instance, do not specify "
"CONFIGTX_PROFILE_SAMPLEINSECURESOLO_ORDERER_ORDERERTYPE, instead simply omit"
" the profile specifics and use the CONFIGTX prefix followed by the elements "
"relative to the profile name such as CONFIGTX_ORDERER_ORDERERTYPE."
