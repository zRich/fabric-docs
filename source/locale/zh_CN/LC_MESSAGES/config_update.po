"Channel configurations contain all of the information relevant to the "
"administration of a channel. Most importantly, the channel configuration "
"specifies which organizations are members of channel, but it also "
"includes other channel-wide configuration information such as channel "
"access policies and block batch sizes."

#: ../../source/config_update.md:11
msgid ""
"This configuration is stored on the ledger in a block, and is therefore "
"known as a configuration (config) block. Configuration blocks contain a "
"single configuration. The first of these blocks is known as the “genesis "
"block” and contains the initial configuration required to bootstrap a "
"channel. Each time the configuration of a channel changes it is done "
"through a new configuration block, with the latest configuration block "
"representing the current channel configuration. Orderers and peers keep "
"the current channel configuration in memory to facilitate all channel "
"operations such as cutting a new block and validating block transactions."

#: ../../source/config_update.md:21

"Because configurations are stored in blocks, updating a config happens "
"through a process called a “configuration transaction” (even though the "
"process is a little different from a normal transaction). Updating a "
"config is a process of pulling the config, translating into a format that"
" humans can read, modifying it and then submitting it for approval."

"For a more in-depth look at the process for pulling a config and "
"translating it into JSON, check out Adding an Org to a Channel. In this "
"doc, we'll be focusing on the different ways you can edit a config and "
"the process for getting it signed."

"Channels are highly configurable, but not infinitely so. Different "
"configuration elements have different modification policies (which "
"specify the group of identities required to sign the config update)."

#: ../../source/config_update.md:38

"To see the scope of what's possible to change it's important to look at a"
" config in JSON format. The Adding an Org to a Channel tutorial generates"
" one, so if you've gone through that doc you can simply refer to it. For "
"those who have not, we'll provide one here (for ease of readability, it "
"might be helpful to put this config into a viewer that supports JSON "
"folding, like atom or Visual Studio)."

"Beyond the definitions of the policies -- defining who can do certain "
"things at the channel level, and who has the permission to change who can"
" change the config -- channels also have other kinds of features that can"
" be modified using a config update. Adding an Org to a Channel takes you "
"through one of the most important -- adding an org to a channel. Some "
"other things that are possible to change with a config update include:"

"There is another important channel configuration (especially for v1.1) "
"known as Capability Requirements. It has its own doc that can be found "

"Let’s say you want to edit the block batch size for the channel (because "
"this is a single numeric field, it’s one of the easiest changes to make)."
" First to make referencing the JSON path easy, we define it as an "
"environment variable."

"To establish this, take a look at your config, find what you’re looking "

"If you find batch size, for example, you’ll see that it’s a value of the "

"Once you’ve modified the JSON, it’s ready to be converted and submitted. "

"Once you’ve successfully generated the protobuf file, it’s time to get it"

"If you have made changes to the default policies in the channel, you’ll "
"need to compute your signature requirements accordingly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note: you may be able to script the signature collection, dependent on "
"your application. In general, you may always collect more signatures than"
" are required."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/config_update.md:953
msgid ""
"The actual process of getting these signatures will depend on how you’ve "
"set up your system, but there are two main implementations. Currently, "
"the Fabric command line defaults to a “pass it along” system. That is, "
"the Admin of the Org proposing a config update sends the update to "
"someone else (another Admin, typically) who needs to sign it. This Admin "
"signs it (or doesn’t) and passes it along to the next Admin, and so on, "
"until there are enough signatures for the config to be submitted."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/config_update.md:961
msgid ""
"This has the virtue of simplicity -- when there are enough signatures, "
"the last Admin can simply submit the config transaction (in Fabric, the "
"peer channel update command includes a signature by default). However, "
"this process will only be practical in smaller channels, since the “pass "
"it along” method can be time consuming."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/config_update.md:967
msgid ""
"The other option is to submit the update to every Admin on a channel and "
"wait for enough signatures to come back. These signatures can then be "
"stitched together and submitted. This makes life a bit more difficult for"
" the Admin who created the config update (forcing them to deal with a "
"file per signer) but is the recommended workflow for users which are "
"developing Fabric management applications."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/config_update.md:974
msgid ""
"Once the config has been added to the ledger, it will be a best practice "
"to pull it and convert it to JSON to check to make sure everything was "
"added correctly. This will also serve as a useful copy of the latest "
"config."
