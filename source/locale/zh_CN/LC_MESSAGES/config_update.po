"Channel configurations contain all of the information relevant to the "
"administration of a channel. Most importantly, the channel configuration "
"specifies which organizations are members of channel, but it also includes "
"other channel-wide configuration information such as channel access policies"
" and block batch sizes."
msgstr ""
"通道配置包含与通道管理相关的所有信息。最重要的是，通道配置指定了哪些组织是通道的成员，但它还包含其他通道范围的配置信息，如通道访问策略和区块批大小。"

"This configuration is stored on the ledger in a block, and is therefore "
"known as a configuration (config) block. Configuration blocks contain a "
"single configuration. The first of these blocks is known as the “genesis "
"block” and contains the initial configuration required to bootstrap a "
"channel. Each time the configuration of a channel changes it is done through"
" a new configuration block, with the latest configuration block representing"
" the current channel configuration. Orderers and peers keep the current "
"channel configuration in memory to facilitate all channel operations such as"
" cutting a new block and validating block transactions."
msgstr ""
"此配置存储在账本的一个区块中，因此称为配置(config)区块。配置区块包含一个配置。第一个区块称为“创世区块”，包含引导通道所需的初始配置。每次通道的配置更改都是通过一个新的配置区块完成的，最新的配置区块表示当前通道配置。排序器和peer将当前通道配置保存在内存中，以方便所有通道操作，例如修剪一个新区块和验证区块交易。"

#: ../../source/config_update.md:21
msgid ""
"Because configurations are stored in blocks, updating a config happens "
"through a process called a “configuration transaction” (even though the "
"process is a little different from a normal transaction). Updating a config "
"is a process of pulling the config, translating into a format that humans "
"can read, modifying it and then submitting it for approval."
msgstr ""
"由于配置存储在区块中，所以更新配置是通过一个称为“配置交易”的流程进行的(尽管该流程与普通交易稍有不同)。更新配置是一个获取配置、将配置转换成人类可读的格式、修改配置并提交批准的过程。"

"The actual process of getting these signatures will depend on how you’ve set"
" up your system, but there are two main implementations. Currently, the "
"Fabric command line defaults to a “pass it along” system. That is, the Admin"
" of the Org proposing a config update sends the update to someone else "
"(another Admin, typically) who needs to sign it. This Admin signs it (or "

"获得这些签名的实际过程将取决于您如何设置系统，但是有两个主要实现。目前，Fabric命令行默认为“pass it "
"along”系统。也就是说，提出配置更新的组织的管理员将更新发送给需要签名的其他人(通常是另一个管理员)。这个管理员对它进行签名(或者不签名)，并将其传递给下一个管理员，以此类推，直到有足够的签名来提交配置为止。"

#: ../../source/config_update.md:961
msgid ""
"This has the virtue of simplicity -- when there are enough signatures, the "

"channel update command includes a signature by default). However, this "
"process will only be practical in smaller channels, since the “pass it "
"along” method can be time consuming."
msgstr ""
"这具有简单性的优点——当有足够的签名时，最后一个管理员可以简单地提交配置交易(在Fabric中，peer channel "
"update命令默认包含一个签名)。但是，这个过程只在较小的通道中实用，因为“pass it along”方法可能会很耗时。"

#: ../../source/config_update.md:967
msgid ""
"The other option is to submit the update to every Admin on a channel and "
"wait for enough signatures to come back. These signatures can then be "
"stitched together and submitted. This makes life a bit more difficult for "
"the Admin who created the config update (forcing them to deal with a file "
"per signer) but is the recommended workflow for users which are developing "
"Fabric management applications."
msgstr ""
"另一个选项是向通道上的每个管理员提交更新，并等待足够的签名返回。然后可以将这些签名装订在一起并提交。这使得创建配置更新的管理员(强制他们为每个签名者处理一个文件)的工作变得更加困难，但是对于正在开发Fabric管理应用程序的用户来说，这是推荐的工作流。"

#: ../../source/config_update.md:974
msgid ""
"Once the config has been added to the ledger, it will be a best practice to "
"pull it and convert it to JSON to check to make sure everything was added "
"correctly. This will also serve as a useful copy of the latest config."
msgstr "一旦配置被添加到账本中，最好将其拉出并将其转换为JSON，以检查是否正确地添加了所有内容。这也将作为最新配置的有用副本。"
