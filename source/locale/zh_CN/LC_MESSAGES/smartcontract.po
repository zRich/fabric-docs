"Self-executing logic that encodes the rules for specific types of network "
"transactions. Chaincode (currently written in Go) is installed and "
"instantiated onto a channel's peers by an appropriately authorized member. "
"End users then invoke chaincode through a client-side application that "
"interfaces with a network peer. Chaincode runs network transactions, which "
"if validated, are appended to the shared ledger and modify world state."
msgstr ""
"其自执行逻辑把各种类型的网络交易编码。链码(当前由GO语言编写)是由适当授权的成员通道节点上安装和实例化。终端用户在对接的网络节点上通过客户端程序获取引用链码。如果链码执行的网络交易被认可，其结果会被附加到共享账本并更新整体状态。"
