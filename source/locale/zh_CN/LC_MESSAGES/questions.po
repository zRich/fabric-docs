"We try to maintain a comprehensive set of documentation for various "
"audiences. However, we realize that often there are questions that remain "
"unanswered. For any technical questions relating to Hyperledger Fabric not "
"answered here, please use `StackOverflow "
"<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hyperledger-fabric>`__. Another "
"approach to getting your questions answered to send an email to the `mailing"
" list <https://lists.hyperledger.org/mailman/listinfo/hyperledger-fabric>`__"
" (hyperledger-fabric@lists.hyperledger.org), or ask your questions on "
"`RocketChat <https://chat.hyperledger.org/>`__ (an alternative to Slack) on "
