"The ledger is the sequenced, tamper-resistant record of all state "

"The ledger is comprised of a blockchain ('chain') to store the immutable,"

msgid ""
"The chain is a transaction log, structured as hash-linked blocks, where "
"each block contains a sequence of N transactions. The block header "
"includes a hash of the block's transactions, as well as a hash of the "
"prior block's header. In this way, all transactions on the ledger are "
"sequenced and cryptographically linked together. In other words, it is "
"not possible to tamper with the ledger data, without breaking the hash "
"links. The hash of the latest block represents every transaction that has"

"The ledger's current state data represents the latest values for all keys"

"Chaincode invocations execute transactions against the current state "

"can therefore be regenerated from the chain at any time. The state "
"database will automatically get recovered (or generated if needed) upon "
"peer startup, before transactions are accepted."

"State database options include LevelDB and CouchDB. LevelDB is the "

#: ../../source/ledger.rst:49
msgid ""
"At a high level, the transaction flow consists of a transaction proposal "
"sent by an application client to specific endorsing peers.  The endorsing"
" peers verify the client signature, and execute a chaincode function to "
"simulate the transaction. The output is the chaincode results, a set of "
"key-value versions that were read in the chaincode (read set), and the "
"set of keys/values that were written in chaincode (write set). The "
"proposal response gets sent back to the client along with an endorsement "
"signature."

#: ../../source/ledger.rst:59

"Before committal, peers will validate the transactions. First, they will "

"signatures against the transaction payload."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ledger.rst:63
msgid ""
"Secondly, peers will perform a versioning check against the transaction "
"read set, to ensure data integrity and protect against threats such as "
"double-spending. Hyperledger Fabric has concurrency control whereby "
"transactions execute in parallel (by endorsers) to increase throughput, "
"and upon commit (by all peers) each transaction is verified to ensure "
"that no other transaction has modified data it has read. In other words, "
"it ensures that the data that was read during chaincode execution has not"
" changed since execution (endorsement) time, and therefore the execution "
"results are still valid and can be committed to the ledger state "
"database. If the data that was read has been changed by another "
"transaction, then the transaction in the block is marked as invalid and "
"is not applied to the ledger state database. The client application is "
"alerted, and can handle the error or retry as appropriate."

"A ledger is a key concept in Hyperledger Fabric; it stores important "

"A ledger contains the current state of a business as a journal of "
"transactions. The earliest European and Chinese ledgers date from almost "
"1000 years ago, and the Sumerians had stone ledgers 4000 years ago -- but"

"You're probably used to looking at your bank account. What's most "
"important to you is the available balance -- it's what you're able to "
"spend at the current moment in time. If you want to see how your balance "
"was derived, then you can look through the transaction credits and debits"
" that determined it. This is a real life example of a ledger -- a state "
"(your bank balance), and a set of ordered transactions (credits and "
"debits) that determine it. Hyperledger Fabric is motivated by these same "
"two concerns -- to present the current value of a set of ledger states, "
"and to capture the history of the transactions that determined these "
"states."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ledger/ledger.md:45
msgid ""
"A ledger doesn't literally store business objects -- instead it stores "
"facts about those objects. When we say \"we store a business object in a "
"ledger\" what we really mean is that we're recording the facts about the "
"current state of an object, and the facts about the history of "
"transactions that led to the current state. In an increasingly digital "
"world, it can feel like we're looking at an object, rather than facts "
"about an object. In the case of a digital object, it's likely that it "
"lives in an external datastore; the facts we store in the ledger allow us"
" to identify its location along with other key information about it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ledger/ledger.md:54

"While the facts about the current state of a business object may change, "
"the history of facts about it is immutable, it can be added to, but it "

"simple yet powerful way to understand it."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ledger/ledger.md:65
msgid ""
"In Hyperledger Fabric, a ledger consists of two distinct, though related,"
" parts -- a world state and a blockchain. Each of these represents a set "
"of facts about a set of business objects."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ledger/ledger.md:69
msgid ""
"Firstly, there's a world state -- a database that holds a cache of the "
"current values of a set of ledger states. The world state makes it easy "
"for a program to directly access the current value of a state rather than"
" having to calculate it by traversing the entire transaction log. Ledger "
"states are, by default, expressed as key-value pairs, and we'll see later"
" how Hyperledger Fabric provides flexibility in this regard. The world "
"state can change frequently, as states can be created, updated and "
"deleted."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ledger/ledger.md:77
msgid ""
"Secondly, there's a blockchain -- a transaction log that records all the "
"changes that have resulted in the current the world state. Transactions "
"are collected inside blocks that are appended to the blockchain -- "
"enabling you to understand the history of changes that have resulted in "
"the current world state. The blockchain data structure is very different "
"to the world state because once written, it cannot be modified; it is "
"immutable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ledger/ledger.md:84
msgid ""
"ledger.ledger A Ledger L comprises blockchain B and world state W, where "
"blockchain B determines world state W. We can also say that world state W"
" is derived from blockchain B."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ledger/ledger.md:88
msgid ""
"It's helpful to think of there being one logical ledger in a Hyperledger "
"Fabric network. In reality, the network maintains multiple copies of a "
"ledger -- which are kept consistent with every other copy through a "
"process called consensus. The term Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is"
" often associated with this kind of ledger -- one that is logically "
"singular, but has many consistent copies distributed throughout a "
"network."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ledger/ledger.md:95
msgid ""
"Let's now examine the world state and blockchain data structures in more "
"detail."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ledger/ledger.md:99
msgid ""
"The world state holds the current value of the attributes of a business "
"object as a unique ledger state. That's useful because programs usually "
"require the current value of an object; it would be cumbersome to "
"traverse the entire blockchain to calculate an object's current value -- "
"you just get it directly from the world state."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ledger/ledger.md:105
msgid ""
"ledger.worldstate A ledger world state containing two states. The first "
"state is: key=CAR1 and value=Audi. The second state has a more complex "
"value: key=CAR2 and value={model:BMW, color=red, owner=Jane}. Both states"
" are at version 0."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ledger/ledger.md:110
msgid ""
"A ledger state records a set of facts about a particular business object."
" Our example shows ledger states for two cars, CAR1 and CAR2, each having"
" a key and a value. An application program can invoke a smart contract "
"which uses simple ledger APIs to get, put and delete states. Notice how a"
" state value can be simple (Audi...) or compound (type:BMW...). The world"
" state is often queried to retrieve objects with certain attributes, for "
"example to find all red BMWs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ledger/ledger.md:118
msgid ""
"The world state is implemented as a database. This makes a lot of sense "
"because a database provides a rich set of operators for the efficient "
"storage and retrieval of states.  We'll see later that Hyperledger Fabric"
" can be configured to use different world state databases to address the "
"needs of different types of state values and the access patterns required"
" by applications, for example in complex queries."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ledger/ledger.md:125
msgid ""
"Applications submit transactions which capture changes to the world "
"state, and these transactions end up being committed to the ledger "
"blockchain. Applications are insulated from the details of this consensus"
" mechanism by the Hyperledger Fabric SDK; they merely invoke a smart "
"contract, and are notified when the transaction has been included in the "
"blockchain (whether valid or invalid). The key design point is that only "
"transactions that are signed by the required set of endorsing "
"organizations will result in an update to the world state. If a "
"transaction is not signed by sufficient endorsers, it will not result in "
"a change of world state. You can read more about how applications use "
"smart contracts, and how to develop applications."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ledger/ledger.md:137
msgid ""
"You'll also notice that a state has an version number, and in the diagram"
" above, states CAR1 and CAR2 are at their starting versions, 0. The "
"version number for internal use by Hyperledger Fabric, and is incremented"
" every time the state changes. The version is checked whenever the state "
"is updated to make sure the current states matches the version at the "
"time of endorsement. This ensures that the world state is changing as "
"expected; that there has not been a concurrent update."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ledger/ledger.md:145
msgid ""
"Finally, when a ledger is first created, the world state is empty. "
"Because any transaction which represents a valid change to world state is"
" recorded on the blockchain, it means that the world state can be re-"
"generated from the blockchain at any time. This can be very convenient --"
" for example, the world state is automatically generated when a peer is "
"created. Moreover, if a peer fails abnormally, the world state can be "
"regenerated on peer restart, before transactions are accepted."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ledger/ledger.md:155
msgid ""
"Let's now turn our attention from the world state to the blockchain. "
"Whereas the world state contains a set of facts relating to the current "
"state of a set of business objects, the blockchain is an historical "
"record of the facts about how these objects arrived at their current "
"states. The blockchain has recorded every previous version of each ledger"
" state and how it has been changed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ledger/ledger.md:161
msgid ""
"The blockchain is structured as sequential log of interlinked blocks, "
"where each block contains a sequence of transactions, each transaction "
"representing a query or update to the world state. The exact mechanism by"
" which transactions are ordered is discussed elsewhere; what's important "
"is that block sequencing, as well as transaction sequencing within "
"blocks, is established when blocks are first created by a Hyperledger "
"Fabric component called the ordering service."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ledger/ledger.md:169
msgid ""
"Each block's header includes a hash of the block's transactions, as well "
"a copy of the hash of the prior block's header. In this way, all "
"transactions on the ledger are sequenced and cryptographically linked "
"together. This hashing and linking makes the ledger data very secure. "
"Even if one node hosting the ledger was tampered with, it would not be "
"able to convince all the other nodes that it has the 'correct' blockchain"
" because the ledger is distributed throughout a network of independent "
"nodes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ledger/ledger.md:177
msgid ""
"The blockchain is always implemented as a file, in contrast to the world "
"state, which uses a database. This is a sensible design choice as the "
"blockchain data structure is heavily biased towards a very small set of "
"simple operations. Appending to the end of the blockchain is the primary "
"operation, and query is currently a relatively infrequent operation."

"blockchain so neatly captures!"
msgstr ""
