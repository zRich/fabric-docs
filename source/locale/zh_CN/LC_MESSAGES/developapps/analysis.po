"Let's analyze commercial paper in a little more detail. PaperNet "
"participants such as MagnetoCorp and DigiBank use commercial paper "
"transactions to achieve their business objectives -- let's examine the "
"structure of a commercial paper and the transactions that affect it over "
"time. We will also consider which organizations in PaperNet need to sign off"
" on a transaction based on the trust relationships among the organizations "
"in the network. Later we'll focus on how money flows between buyers and "
"sellers; for now, let's focus on the first paper issued by MagnetoCorp."

"让我们更详细地分析一下商业票据。PaperNet的参与者，如MagnetoCorp和DigiBank，使用商业票据交易来实现他们的业务目标——让我们研究一下商业票据的结构以及随着时间的推移影响它的交易。我们还将根据网络中组织之间的信任关系，考虑PaperNet中的哪些组织需要签署交易。稍后我们将重点讨论资金如何在买家和卖家之间流动；现在，让我们专注于MagnetoCorp发表的第一篇论文。"

"This final redeem transaction has ended the commercial paper's lifecycle -- "

"查看怎样发起交易具有属性和值的结构。这种交易结构与票据00001的结构不同，但非常匹配。这是因为它们是不同的东西——票据00001反映了PaperNet的状态，这是发起交易的结果。正是发起交易背后的逻辑(我们无法看到)获取这些属性并创建了票据。因为交易创建了票据，这意味着这些结构之间有着非常密切的关系。"

"See how the buy transaction has fewer properties that end up in this paper. "
"That's because this transaction only modifies this paper. It's only New "

"You might ask why the Purchase time and Price properties are not captured in"
" paper 00001? This comes back to the difference between the transaction and "
"the paper. The 4.94 M USD price tag is actually a property of the "
"transaction, rather than a property of this paper. Spend a little time "
"thinking about this difference; it is not as obvious as it seems. We're "
"going to see later that the ledger will record both pieces of information --"
" the history of all transactions that affect this paper, as well its latest "
"state. Being clear on this separation of information is really important."
msgstr ""
"您可能会问，为什么在票据00001中没有记录购买时间和价格属性？这又回到了交易和票据之间的区别。494万美元的价格标签实际上是交易的属性，而不是票据的属性。花点时间想想这种不同；这并不像看上去那么明显。我们稍后将看到，账本将记录这两条信息——影响票据的所有交易的历史，以及它的最新状态。明确这种信息的分离是非常重要的。"
