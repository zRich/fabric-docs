"Let's analyze commercial paper in a little more detail. PaperNet "
"participants such as MagnetoCorp and DigiBank use commercial paper "
"transactions to achieve their business objectives -- let's examine the "
"structure of a commercial paper and the transactions that affect it over "
"time. We will also consider which organizations in PaperNet need to sign off"
" on a transaction based on the trust relationships among the organizations "
"in the network. Later we'll focus on how money flows between buyers and "
"sellers; for now, let's focus on the first paper issued by MagnetoCorp."

"You might ask why the Purchase time and Price properties are not captured in"

"transaction, rather than a property of this paper. Spend a little time "
"thinking about this difference; it is not as obvious as it seems. We're "

msgstr ""
"您可能会问，为什么在票据00001中没有记录购买时间和价格属性？这又回到了交易和票据之间的区别。494万美元的价格标签实际上是交易的属性，而不是票据的属性。花点时间想想这种不同；这并不像看上去那么明显。我们稍后将看到，账本将记录这两条信息——影响票据的所有交易的历史，以及它的最新状态。明确这种信息的分离是非常重要的。"
