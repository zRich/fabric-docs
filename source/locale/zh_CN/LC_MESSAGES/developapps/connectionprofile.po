"A connection profile describes a set of components, including peers, "
"orderers and certificate authorities in a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain "
"network. It also contains channel and organization information relating to "
"these components. A connection profile is primarily used by an application "
"to configure a gateway that handles all network interactions, allowing it to"
" focus on business logic. A connection profile is normally created by an "
"administrator who understands the network topology."

msgid ""
"A connection profile is used to configure a gateway. Gateways are important "

"Two applications, issue and buy, use gateways 1&2 configured with connection"
" profiles 1&2. Each profile describes a different subset of MagnetoCorp and "
"DigiBank network components. Each connection profile must contain sufficient"
" information for a gateway to interact with the network on behalf of the "
"issue and buy applications. See the text for a detailed explanation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionprofile.md:32
msgid ""
"A connection profile contains a description of a network view, expressed in "
"a technical syntax, which can either be JSON or YAML. In this topic, we use "
"the YAML representation, as it's easier for you to read. Static gateways "
"need more information than dynamic gateways because the latter can use "
"service discovery to dynamically augment the information in a connection "
"profile."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionprofile.md:39
msgid ""
"A connection profile should not be an exhaustive description of a network "
"channel; it just needs to contain enough information sufficient for a "
"gateway that's using it. In the network above, connection profile 1 needs to"
" contain at least the endorsing organizations and peers for the issue "
"transaction, as well as identifying the peers that will notify the gateway "
"when the transaction has been committed to the ledger."

"It's easiest to think of a connection profile as describing a view of the "

"Service Discovery can augment the information in a connection profile. "
"Specifically, dynamic gateways can be configured with minimal Fabric "
"topology information; the rest can be discovered."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionprofile.md:62
msgid ""
"A static connection profile is normally created by an administrator who "
"understands the network topology in detail. That's because a static profile "
"can contain quite a lot of information, and an administrator needs to "
"capture this in the corresponding connection profile. In contrast, dynamic "
"profiles minimize the amount of definition required, and therefore can be a "
"better choice for developers who want to get going quickly, or "
"administrators who want to create a more responsive gateway. Connection "
"profiles are created in either the YAML or JSON format using an editor of "
"choice."

"We'll see how to define a connection profile in a moment; let's first see "

msgid ""
"After loading some required classes, see how the paperNet.yaml gateway file "

"method."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionprofile.md:92
msgid ""
"By configuring a gateway with this connection profile, the issue application"
" is providing the gateway with the relevant network topology it should use "
"to process transactions. That's because the connection profile contains "
"sufficient information about the PaperNet channels, organizations, peers, "
"orderers and CAs to ensure transactions can be successfully processed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionprofile.md:98
msgid ""
"It's good practice for a connection profile to define more than one peer for"
" any given organization -- it prevents a single point of failure. This "
"practice also applies to dynamic gateways; to provide more than one starting"
" point for service discovery."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionprofile.md:103
msgid ""
"A DigiBank buy application would typically configure its gateway with a "
"similar connection profile, but with some important differences. Some "
"elements will be the same, such as the channel; some elements will overlap, "
"such as the endorsing peers. Other elements will be completely different, "
"such as notification peers or certificate authorities for example."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionprofile.md:109
msgid ""
"The connectionOptions passed to a gateway complement the connection profile."
" They allow an application to declare how it would like the gateway to use "
"the connection profile. They are interpreted by the SDK to control "
"interaction patterns with network components, for example to select which "
"identity to connect with, or which peers to use for event notifications. "

"application operations relate to organizations rather than channels. For "
"example, an application can request notification from one or all peers "
