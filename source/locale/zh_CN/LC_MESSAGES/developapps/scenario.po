"MagnetoCorp is a well-respected company that makes self-driving electric "
"vehicles. In early April 2020, MagnetoCorp won a large order to manufacture "
"10,000 Model D cars for Daintree, a new entrant in the personal transport "
"market. Although the order represents a significant win for MagnetoCorp, "
"Daintree will not have to pay for the vehicles until they start to be "
"delivered on November 1, six months after the deal was formally agreed "
"between MagnetoCorp and Daintree."
msgstr ""
"MagnetoCorp是一家生产自动驾驶电动汽车的知名公司。在2020年4月初，MagnetoCorp赢得了一份为Daintree公司生产10000辆D型汽车的大订单。Daintree公司是个人交通市场的新参与者。尽管该订单代表着MagnetoCorp的重大胜利，但在11月1日开始交付之前，Daintree不必为这些车辆付款。6个月前，MagnetoCorp与Daintree已正式达成协议。"

"To manufacture the vehicles, MagnetoCorp will need to hire 1000 workers for "
"at least 6 months. This puts a short term strain on its finances -- it will "
"require an extra 5M USD each month to pay these new employees. Commercial "
"paper is designed to help MagnetoCorp overcome its short term financing "
"needs -- to meet payroll every month based on the expectation that it will "
"be cash rich when Daintree starts to pay for its new Model D cars."
msgstr ""
"为了制造这些汽车，MagnetoCorp将需要雇佣1000名工人至少工作6个月。这给它的财务带来了短期压力——每月需要额外支付500万美元给这些新员工。商业票据的目的是帮助MagnetoCorp克服其短期融资需求——在Daintree开始为其新款D型汽车付款时，该公司预计将拥有充足的现金，因此每月都要发放工资。"

"At the end of May, MagnetoCorp needs 5M USD to meet payroll for the extra "
"workers it hired on May 1. To do this, it issues a commercial paper with a "
"face value of 5M USD with a maturity date 6 months in the future -- when it "
"expects to see cash flow from Daintree. DigiBank thinks that MagnetoCorp is "
"creditworthy, and therefore doesn't require much of a premium above the "
"central bank base rate of 2%, which would value 4.95M USD today at 5M USD in"
" 6 months time. It therefore purchases the MagnetoCorp 6 month commercial "
"paper for 4.94M USD -- a slight discount compared to the 4.95M USD it is "
"worth. DigiBank fully expects that it will be able to redeem 5M USD from "
"MagnetoCorp in 6 months time, making it a profit of 10K USD for bearing the "
"increased risk associated with this commercial paper. This extra 10K means "
"it receives a 2.4% return on investment -- significantly better than the "
"risk free return of 2%."
msgstr ""
"5月底，MagnetoCorp需要500万美元来支付5月1日雇佣的额外工人的工资。为此，它发行了一张面值为500万美元的商业票据，期限为6个月，预计届时将看到Daintree的现金流入。Digbank认为MagnetoCorp是有信誉的，因此不需要比央行2%的基准利率高多少的溢价。按照目前的汇率，6个月后的500万美元相当于485万美元。因此，该公司以494万美元的价格购买了MagnetoCorp6个月期商业票据——与其价值485万美元相比，这是一个小折扣。DigiBank完全预计，在6个月内，它将能够从MagnetoCorp手中赎回500万美元，从而为自己带来1万美元的利润，因为它承担了与这张商业票据相关的风险增加。这额外的1万美元意味着它的投资回报率为2.4%，明显高于2%的无风险回报率。"

"At the end of June, when MagnetoCorp issues a new commercial paper for 5M "
"USD to meet June's payroll, it is purchased by BigFund for 4.94M USD.  "
"That's because the commercial conditions are roughly the same in June as "
"they are in May, resulting in BigFund valuing MagnetoCorp commercial paper "
"at the same price that DigiBank did in May."
msgstr ""
"6月底，当MagnetoCorp发行一份500万美元的新商业票据来支付6月份的工资时，它被BigFund以494万美元的价格收购。这是因为6月的商业环境与5月大致相同，导致BigFund对MagnetoCorp商业票据的估值与DigiBank"
" 5月的估值相同。"

"Each subsequent month, MagnetoCorp can issue new commercial paper to meet "
"its payroll obligations, and these may be purchased by DigiBank, or any "
"other participant in the PaperNet commercial paper network -- BigFund, "
"HedgeMatic or BrokerHouse. These organizations may pay more or less for the "
"commercial paper depending on two factors -- the central bank base rate, and"
" the risk associated with MagnetoCorp. This latter figure depends on a "
"variety of factors such as the production of Model D cars, and the "
"creditworthiness of MagnetoCorp as assessed by RateM, a ratings agency."
msgstr ""
"此后的每个月，MagnetoCorp都可以发行新的商业票据，以履行其薪资义务，这些票据可能被DigiBank或PaperNet商业票据网络的任何其他参与者购买——BigFund、HedgeMatic或BrokerHouse。这些机构可能会为商业票据支付更多或更少的费用，这取决于两个因素——央行基准利率和与MagnetoCorp相关的风险。后者的数字取决于多种因素，比如D型车的产量，以及评级机构RateM评估的MagnetoCorp的信誉。"

"The organizations in PaperNet have different roles, MagnetoCorp issues "
"paper, DigiBank, BigFund, HedgeMatic and BrokerHouse trade paper and RateM "
"rates paper. Organizations of the same role, such as DigiBank, Bigfund, "
"HedgeMatic and BrokerHouse are competitors. Organizations of different roles"
" are not necessarily competitors, yet might still have opposing business "
"interest, for example MagentoCorp will desire a high rating for its papers "
"to sell them at a high price, while DigiBank would benefit from a low "
"rating, such that it can buy them at a low price. As can be seen, even a "
"seemingly simple network such as PaperNet can have complex trust "
"relationships. A blockchain can help establish trust among organizations "
"that are competitors or have opposing business interests that might lead to "
"disputes. Fabric in particular has the means to capture even fine-grained "
"trust relationships."
msgstr ""
"PaperNet中的组织有不同的角色，如MagnetoCorp发行票据、DigiBank、BigFund、HedgeMatic和BrokerHouse交易票据以及RateM对票据估价。扮演同样角色的组织，如Digbank、Bigfund、HedgeMatic和BrokerHouse，都是竞争对手。组织不同的角色不一定是竞争对手，但可能仍有对立的商业利益，例如MagentoCorp将期望高评级的票据以高价卖给他们,而DigiBank将受益于较低的评级,这样它能以较低的价格买进。可以看出，即使是看似简单的网络，如PaperNet，也可能具有复杂的信任关系。区块链可以帮助在竞争对手之间建立信任，或者在可能导致争议的商业利益对立的组织之间建立信任。Fabric尤其能够捕获甚至细粒度的信任关系。"

"Let's pause the MagnetoCorp story for a moment, and develop the client "
"applications and smart contracts that PaperNet uses to issue, buy, sell and "

"the organizations.  We'll come back to the role of the rating agency, RateM,"
" a little later."
msgstr ""
"让我们暂停一下MagnetoCorp的故事，开发客户端应用程序和智能合约，PaperNet使用这些应用程序发行、购买、销售和赎回商业票据，并获得组织之间的信任关系。我们稍后会回到评级机构RateM的角色。"
