"Endorsement policies define the smallest set of organizations that are "
"required to endorse a transaction in order for it to be valid. To endorse, "
"an organization's endorsing peer needs to run the smart contract associated "
"with the transaction and sign its outcome. When the ordering service sends "
"the transaction to the committing peers, they will each individually check "
"whether the endorsements in the transaction fulfill the endorsement policy. "
"If this is not the case, the transaction is invalidated and it will have no "
"effect on world state."
msgstr ""
"背书策略定义了组织的最小集合，为了使交易有效，这些组织需要对交易进行背书。要进行背书，组织的背书节点需要运行与交易相关的智能合约并签署其结果。当排序服务将交易发送给提交节点时，它们将各自检查交易中的背书是否符合背书策略。如果不是这样，交易将无效，并且它对世界状态不会有影响。"

"Endorsement policies work at two different granularities: they can be set "
"for an entire namespace, as well as for individual state keys. They are "
"formulated using basic logic expressions such as AND and OR. For example, in"
" PaperNet this could be used as follows: the endorsement policy for a paper "
"that has been sold from MagnetoCorp to DigiBank could be set to "
"AND(MagnetoCorp.peer, DigiBank.peer), requiring any changes to this paper to"
" be endorsed by both MagnetoCorp and DigiBank."
msgstr ""
"背书策略有两种不同的粒度：以整个命名空间，或者以单个状态键设置它们。它们是使用基本逻辑表达式（如AND和OR）来表示的。例如，在PaperNet中可以这样使用：从MagnetoCorp出售给DigiBank的纸张的背书策略可以设置为"
" AND(MagnetoCorp.peer, "
"DigiBank.peer)，要求对该纸张所作的任何修改均须获得MagnetoCorp和DigiBank的背书。"
