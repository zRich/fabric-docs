#: ../../source/developapps/connectionoptions.md:19
msgid ""
"A connection option specifies a particular aspect of a gateway's behaviour. "
"Gateways are important for many reasons, the primary being to allow an "
"application to focus on business logic and smart contracts, while it manages"
" interactions with the many components of a network."

"The different interaction points where connection options control behaviour."
" These options are explained fully in the text."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionoptions.md:28
msgid ""
"One example of a connection option might be to specify that the gateway used"
" by the issue application should use identity Isabella to submit "
"transactions to the papernet network. Another might be that a gateway should"
" wait for all three nodes from MagnetoCorp to confirm a transaction has been"
" committed returning control. Connection options allow applications to "
"specify the precise behaviour of a gateway's interaction with the network. "
"Without a gateway, applications need to do a lot more work; gateways save "
"you time, make your application more readable, and less error prone."

msgid "Usage"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionoptions.md:39
msgid ""
"We'll describe the full set of connection options available to an "
"application in a moment; let's first see how they are specified by the "
"sample MagnetoCorp issue application:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionoptions.md:59
msgid ""
"See how the identity and wallet options are simple properties of the "
"connectionOptions object. They have values userName and wallet respectively,"
" which were set earlier in the code. Contrast these options with the "
"eventHandlerOptions option which is an object in its own right. It has two "
"properties: commitTimeout: 100 (measured in seconds) and strategy: "
"EventStrategies.MSPID_SCOPE_ANYFORTX."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionoptions.md:66
msgid ""
"See how connectionOptions is passed to a gateway as a complement to "
"connectionProfile; the network is identified by the connection profile and "
"the options specify precisely how the gateway should interact with it. Let's"
" now look at the available options."

"wallet identifies the wallet that will be used by the gateway on behalf of "
"the application. See interaction 1; the wallet is specified by the "
"application, but it's actually the gateway that retrieves identities from "
"it."

"wallet to use, whether that's file system, in-memory, HSM or database."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"identity is the user identity that the application will use from wallet. See"
" interaction 2a; the user identity is specified by the application and "
"represents the user of the application, Isabella, 2b. The identity is "
"actually retrieved by the gateway."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionoptions.md:89
msgid ""
"In our example, Isabella's identity will be used by different MSPs (2c, 2d) "
"to identify her as being from MagnetoCorp, and having a particular role "
"within it. These two facts will correspondingly determine her permission "
"over resources, such as being able to read and write the ledger, for "
"example."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionoptions.md:94
msgid ""
"A user identity must be specified. As you can see, this identity is "
"fundamental to the idea that Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned network --"
" all actors have an identity, including applications, peers and orderers, "
"which determines their control over resources. You can read more about this "
"idea in the membership services topic."

"clientTlsIdentity is the identity that is retrieved from a wallet (3a) and "

"channel components, such as peers and orderers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionoptions.md:104
msgid ""
"Note that this identity is different to the user identity.  Even though "
"clientTlsIdentity is important for secure communications, it is not as "

"secure network communications."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionoptions.md:109
msgid ""
"clientTlsIdentity is optional. You are advised to set it in production "
"environments. You should always use a different clientTlsIdentity to "
"identity because these identities have very different meanings and "
"lifecycles. For example, if your clientTlsIdentity was compromised, then so "
"would your identity; it's more secure to keep them separate."

"eventHandlerOptions.commitTimeout is optional. It specifies, in seconds, the"
" maximum amount of time the gateway should wait for a transaction to be "

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionoptions.md:157
msgid ""
"A user-defined event handler is only necessary if you have very specific "
"event handling requirements; in general, one of the built-in event "

"a transaction has been committed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionoptions.md:163
msgid ""
"If you do specify a user-defined event handler, it does not affect your "
"application logic; it is quite separate from it. The handler is called by "
"the SDK during processing; it decides when to call it, and uses its results "

"Typically developers will write applications that use docker containers for "

"in the same manner as network components and therefore address translation "

" false or use the environment variable override."

msgid ""
"eventHandlerOptions.commitTimeout and eventHandlerOptions.strategy work "
"together. For example, commitTimeout: 100 and strategy: "
"EventStrategies.MSPID_SCOPE_ANYFORTX means that the gateway will wait for up"
" to 100 seconds for any peer to confirm a transaction has been committed. In"
" contrast, specifying strategy:  EventStrategies.NETWORK_SCOPE_ALLFORTX "
"means that the gateway will wait up to 100 seconds for all peers in all "
"organizations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionoptions.md:212
msgid ""
"The default value of eventHandlerOptions.strategy: "
"EventStrategies.MSPID_SCOPE_ALLFORTX will wait for all peers in the "
"application's organization to commit the transaction. This is a good default"
" because applications can be sure that all their peers have an up-to-date "
"copy of the ledger, minimizing concurrency issues."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionoptions.md:219
msgid ""
"However, as the number of peers in an organization grows, it becomes a "
"little unnecessary to wait for all peers, in which case using a pluggable "
"event handler can provide a more efficient strategy. For example the same "
"set of peers could be used to submit transactions and listen for "
"notifications, on the safe assumption that consensus will keep all ledgers "
"synchronized."

"Service discovery requires clientTlsIdentity to be set. That's because the "
"peers exchanging information with an application need to be confident that "

"of whether or not it is set."

"Although applications can set connection options when they connect to the "
"gateway, it can be necessary for these options to be overridden by an "

msgid ""
"Because the discovery options enabled and asLocalHost are most frequently "
"required to be overridden by administrators, the environment variables "
