"In cases where a group of organizations on a channel need to keep data "
"private from other organizations on that channel, they have the option to "
"create a new channel comprising just the organizations who need access to "
"the data. However, creating separate channels in each of these cases creates"
" additional administrative overhead (maintaining chaincode versions, "
"policies, MSPs, etc), and doesn't allow for use cases in which you want all "
"channel participants to see a transaction while keeping a portion of the "
"data private."
msgstr ""
"在某个通道上的一组组织需要对该通道上的其他组织保持数据私密的情况下，它们可以选择创建一个新通道，其中只包含需要访问数据的组织。但是，在每一种情况下创建单独的通道会产生额外的管理开销(维护链码版本、策略、MSPs等)，并且不允许在保持部分数据私有的同时，让所有通道参与者都看到交易。"

"That's why, starting in v1.2, Fabric offers the ability to create private "
"data collections, which allow a defined subset of organizations on a channel"
" the ability to endorse, commit, or query private data without having to "
"create a separate channel."
msgstr ""
"这就是为什么从v1.2开始，Fabric就提供了创建私有数据集合的能力，这使得通道上定义的组织子集能够背书、提交或查询私有数据，而不必创建单独的通道。"

"\"side\" database, or \"SideDB\"), which can be accessed from chaincode on "
"these authorized peers. The ordering service is not involved here and does "
"not see the private data. Note that because gossip distributes the private "
