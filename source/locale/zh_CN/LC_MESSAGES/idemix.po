msgid ""
"Idemix is a cryptographic protocol suite, which provides strong "
"authentication as well as privacy-preserving features such as "
"**anonymity**, the ability to transact without revealing the identity of "
"the transactor, and **unlinkability**, the ability of a single identity "
"to send multiple transactions without revealing that the transactions "
"were sent by the same identity."

"The certificate/credential concept and the issuance process are very "

"signed with a signature that cannot be forged and there is a secret key "
"to which a credential is cryptographically bound."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/idemix.rst:221
msgid ""
"The main difference between a standard X.509 certificate and an Identity "
"Mixer credential is the signature scheme that is used to certify the "
"attributes. The signatures underlying the Identity Mixer system allow for"
" efficient proofs of the possession of a signature and the corresponding "
"attributes without revealing the signature and (selected) attribute "
"values themselves. We use zero-knowledge proofs to ensure that such "
"\"knowledge\" or \"information\" is not revealed while ensuring that the "
"signature over some attributes is valid and the user is in possession of "
"the corresponding credential secret key."

#: ../../source/idemix.rst:230

"Such proofs, like X.509 certificates, can be verified with the public key"

"With regard to unlinkability, when an X.509 certificate is presented, all"

"To avoid such linkability, fresh X.509 certificates need to be used every"

"transactions to the user."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/idemix.rst:244

"Idemix helps to avoid linkability with respect to both the CA and "
