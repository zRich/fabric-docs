"Fabric uses access control lists (ACLs) to manage access to resources by "
"associating a policy --- which specifies a rule that evaluates to true or"
" false, given a set of identities --- with the resource. Fabric contains "
"a number of default ACLs. In this document, we'll talk about how they're "
"formatted and how the defaults can be overridden."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/access_control.md:14
msgid ""
"But before we can do that, it's necessary to understand a little about "
"resources and policies."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/access_control.md:19
msgid ""
"Users interact with Fabric by targeting a user chaincode, system "
"chaincode, or an events stream source. As such, these endpoints are "
"considered \"resources\" on which access control should be exercised."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/access_control.md:24
msgid ""
"Application developers need to be aware of these resources and the "
"default policies associated with them. The complete list of these "
"resources are found in configtx.yaml. You can look at a sample "
"configtx.yaml file here."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/access_control.md:28
msgid ""
"The resources named in configtx.yaml is an exhaustive list of all "
"internal resources currently defined by Fabric. The loose convention "
"adopted there is <component>/<resource>. So cscc/GetConfigBlock is the "
"resource for the GetConfigBlock call in the CSCC component."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/access_control.md:35
msgid ""
"Policies are fundamental to the way Fabric works because they allow the "
"identity (or set of identities) associated with a request to be checked "
"against the policy associated with the resource needed to fulfill the "
"request. Endorsement policies are used to determine whether a transaction"
" has been appropriately endorsed. The policies defined in the channel "
"configuration are referenced as modification policies as well as for "
"access control, and are defined in the channel configuration itself."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/access_control.md:42
msgid ""
"Policies can be structured in one of two ways: as Signature policies or "
"as an ImplicitMeta policy."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/access_control.md:47
msgid ""
"These policies identify specific users who must sign in order for a "
"policy to be satisfied. For example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/access_control.md:58
msgid ""
"This policy construct can be interpreted as: the policy named MyPolicy "
"can only be satisfied by the signature of an identity with role of \"a "
"peer from Org1\" or \"a peer from Org2\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/access_control.md:62
msgid ""
"Signature policies support arbitrary combinations of AND, OR, and NOutOf,"
" allowing the construction of extremely powerful rules like: \"An admin "
"of org A and two other admins, or 11 of 20 org admins\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/access_control.md:68
msgid ""
"ImplicitMeta policies aggregate the result of policies deeper in the "
"configuration hierarchy that are ultimately defined by Signature "
"policies. They support default rules like \"A majority of the "
"organization admins\". These policies use a different but still very "
"simple syntax as compared to Signature policies: <ALL|ANY|MAJORITY> "
"<sub_policy>."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/access_control.md:74
msgid "For example: ANY Readers or MAJORITY Admins."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/access_control.md:76
msgid ""
"Note that in the default policy configuration Admins have an operational "
"role. Policies that specify that only Admins --- or some subset of Admins"
" --- have access to a resource will tend to be for sensitive or "
"operational aspects of the network (such as instantiating chaincode on a "
"channel). Writers will tend to be able to propose ledger updates, such as"
" a transaction, but will not typically have administrative permissions. "
"Readers have a passive role. They can access information but do not have "
"the permission to propose ledger updates nor do can they perform "
"administrative tasks. These default policies can be added to, edited, or "
"supplemented, for example by the new peer and client roles (if you have "
"NodeOU support)."

msgid "Here's an example of an ImplicitMeta policy structure:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/access_control.md:96
msgid ""
"Here, the policy AnotherPolicy can be satisfied by the MAJORITY of "
"Admins, where Admins is eventually being specified by lower level "
"Signature policy."

"Access control defaults exist inside configtx.yaml, the file that "
"configtxgen uses to build channel configurations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/access_control.md:104
msgid ""
"Access control can be updated one of two ways, either by editing "
"configtx.yaml itself, which will propagate the ACL change to any new "
"channels, or by updating access control in the channel configuration of a"
" particular channel."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/access_control.md:110
msgid ""
"ACLs are formatted as a key-value pair consisting of a resource function "
"name followed by a string. To see what this looks like, reference this "
"sample configtx.yaml file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/access_control.md:113
msgid "Two excerpts from this sample:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/access_control.md:125

"These ACLs define that access to peer/Propose and event/Block resources "
"is restricted to identities satisfying the policy defined at the "
"canonical path /Channel/Application/Writers and "
"/Channel/Application/Readers, respectively."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/access_control.md:131
msgid ""
"In cases where it will be necessary to override ACL defaults when "
"bootstrapping a network, or to change the ACLs before a channel has been "
"bootstrapped, the best practice will be to update configtx.yaml."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/access_control.md:135
msgid ""
"Let's say you want to modify the peer/Propose ACL default --- which "
"specifies the policy for invoking chaincodes on a peer -- from "
"/Channel/Application/Writers to a policy called MyPolicy."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/access_control.md:139
msgid ""
"This is done by adding a policy called MyPolicy (it could be called "
"anything, but for this example we'll call it MyPolicy). The policy is "
"defined in the Application.Policies section inside configtx.yaml and "
"specifies a rule to be checked to grant or deny access to a user. For "
"this example, we'll be creating a Signature policy identifying "
"SampleOrg.admin."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/access_control.md:161

"Once these fields have been changed in configtx.yaml, the configtxgen "
"tool will use the policies and ACLs defined when creating a channel "

" and policies is created."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/access_control.md:175
msgid ""
"Once MyPolicy has been bootstrapped into the channel configuration, it "

"If channels have already been created that want to use MyPolicy to "

"After pulling, translating, and stripping the configuration block of its "

"If a member makes a request that calls multiple system chaincodes, all of"

msgid ""
"For example, peer/Propose refers to any proposal request on a channel. If"
" the particular proposal requires access to two system chaincodes that "
"requires an identity satisfying Writers and one system chaincode that "
"requires an identity satisfying MyPolicy, then the member submitting the "
"proposal must have an identity that evaluates to \"true\" for both "
"Writers and MyPolicy."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/access_control.md:274
msgid ""
"In the default configuration, Writers is a signature policy whose rule is"
" SampleOrg.member. In other words, \"any member of my organization\". "
"MyPolicy, listed above, has a rule of SampleOrg.admin, or \"any admin of "
"my organization\". To satisfy these ACLs, the member would have to be "
"both an administrator and a member of SampleOrg. By default, all "
"administrators are members (though not all administrators are members), "
"but it is possible to overwrite these policies to whatever you want them "
"to be. As a result, it's important to keep track of these policies to "
"ensure that the ACLs for peer proposals are not impossible to satisfy "
"(unless that is the intention)."

msgid ""
"Previously, the management of access control lists was done in an "
"isolated_data section of the channel creation transaction and updated via"
" PEER_RESOURCE_UPDATE transactions. Originally, it was thought that the "
"resources tree would handle the update of several functions that, "
"ultimately, were handled in other ways, so maintaining a separate "
"parallel peer configuration tree was judged to be unnecessary."

msgid ""
"Migration for customers using the experimental resources tree in v1.1 is "
"possible. Because the official v1.2 release does not support the old ACL "
"methods, the network operators should shut down all their peers.  Then, "
"they should upgrade them to v1.2, submit a channel reconfiguration "
"transaction which enables the v1.2 capability and sets the desired ACLs, "
"and then finally restart the upgraded peers.  The restarted peers will "
"immediately consume the new channel configuration and enforce the ACLs as"
" desired."
