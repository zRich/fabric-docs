"To help understand this process, we've created the "
":doc:`upgrading_your_network_tutorial` tutorial that will take you "
"through most of the major upgrade steps, including upgrading peers and "
"orderers. We've included both a script as well as the individual steps to"

"Because our tutorial leverages the :doc:`build_network` (BYFN) sample, it"
" has certain limitations (it does not use Fabric CA, for example). "
"Therefore we have included a section at the end of the tutorial that will"
" show how to upgrade your CA, Kafka clusters, CouchDB, Zookeeper, "
"vendored chaincode shims, and Node SDK clients."
